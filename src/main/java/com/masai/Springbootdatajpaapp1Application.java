/*
 * @SpringBootApplication: This annotation is a composite annotation that
 * combines three other annotations: @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration,
 * and @ComponentScan. It's typically used to indicate that a class is the main
 * class of a Spring Boot application and that it should be treated as a
 * configuration class, enabling auto-configuration of various Spring components
 * and scanning for Spring components within the specified package and its
 * sub-packages.
 * 
 * public class Springbootdatajpaapp1Application {: This line defines the main
 * class of your Spring Boot application. The class name
 * Springbootdatajpaapp1Application is the name of your main class. The curly
 * braces {} contain the code for the class.
 * 
 * public static void main(String[] args) {: This line is the main method, which
 * serves as the entry point for your application. When you run your
 * application, the code inside this method will be executed.
 * 
 * SpringApplication.run(Springbootdatajpaapp1Application.class, args);: This
 * line calls the run method of the SpringApplication class to start your Spring
 * Boot application. It takes two arguments:
 * 
 * Springbootdatajpaapp1Application.class: This argument specifies the main
 * class of your application, allowing Spring Boot to configure and launch your
 * application.
 * args: This argument is an array of command-line arguments that you can pass
 * to your application when running it
